# mRNA display/deep learning
 
## About

This repository holds python scripts to reproduce the results of mRNA display/deep learning-based study to profile the substrate preferences of LazBF and LazDEF enzymes (everything from loading .fastq files to training and evaluating tensorflow-based models).

1. All metaparametes are specified in code/config.py (set up to analyze library 6C6, i.e., LazDEF profiling results)
2. Primary code is in ./code/utils
3. Model definition can be found in ./code/tf/cnn_model.py
4. Fully trained model weights are either ./model/55_r6_cnn_v5_fully_trained.h5 (LazBF model) or model/66_r5_ccn_v5_fully_trained_v2.h5 (LazDEF model).
5. ECFP feature matrices are ./feature_matrices/DENSE_Morgan_F_r=4_LazBF and ./feature_matrices/DENSE_Morgan_F_r=4_LazDEF
6. The associated NGS sequencing data is uploaded to DDBJ (accession number: DRA013287)
