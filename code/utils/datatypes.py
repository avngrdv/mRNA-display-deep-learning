class Data:
    '''
    During analysis, data is stored as a Data object instance. Data is just a
    container for individual samples, which are stored as SequencingSample objects.
    Any number of DNA sequences can be a sample in principle, but in practice, 
    most of the time one sample = a single .fastq file. SequencingSample objects 
    have four public attributes: 
    
    	SequencingSample.name: sample name (as a str)
        SequencingSample.D: a list of DNA sequences (can be set as None)
    	SequencingSample.Q: a list of Q score sequences (can be set as None)
    	SequencingSample.P: a list of peptide sequences (can be set as None)
    	
    These lists are stored as numpy arrays: 1D prior to calling 
    FastqParser.transform() or FastqParser.translate(), and 2D arrays the 
    entire time after that; shape: (number of entries, sequence length).
    Because the sequences for different reads may have a different length,
    arrays are padded to the longest sequence.
    
    The number of entries in each array is kept equal throughout the process 
    unless one or more of the attributes are set to None. Although any given 
    filtration routine [for example, FastqParser.q_score_filt()] acts on a single
    array [SequencingSample.Q in this example], the entries for all three arrays
    are discarded/kept as a result.
    
    Depending on how many and what kinds of templates are specified in 
    LibraryDesign, any given entry in SequencingSample may in principle be 
    compatible with several templates simultaneously. Figuring out what entry
    should be assigned to what kind of template is one of the primary objectives
    of the parser. Initially, [i.e. right after calling FastqParser.translate()] 
    the parser deems every sequence to be compatible with every specified 
    template. As filtration goes on, op by op, this compatibility is refined.
    I call the state of the assignment for a particular SequencingSample
    _sample’s internal state_. Some ops [for instance, FastqParser.fetch_at()] 
    need to know exactly which template should be associated with which entry; 
    if they find an entry that is compatible with multiple possible templates, 
    they will “collapse” sample’s internal state, by choosing one compatible
    template and assigning everything else as incompatible. Refer to the list
    of ops below for details on which ops can collapse sample’s internal state. 
    In general, these should be called after filtration ops.
